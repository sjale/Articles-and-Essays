IMPEACH CONGRESS

Our aim, simply and unequivocally put, is the replacement of 100% of the members of congress within 3 elections-- 6 years.

Problem: Congress is fucking terrible. We all hate them, and we all know why we hate them.

The country is littered with politically* impossible challenges (money in elections, gerrymandering, the electoral college, the deficit, social security). 
	*note: Politically impossible. Not actually impossible.

Congress currently is unable to take action on any of these problems, due to the influence of special interests and their constituents, as well as their lack of testicular fortitude.

TL;DR: Career politicans can not and will never solve our nation's greatest problems.

Solution: We elect a new congress. 

We all know amazing people in this country. The types of people who should be in congress, but aren't. You know the people I'm talking about. We all do.

These special people live in every congressional district in America. We convince them to run for Congress.

Examining the voter turnout in each district in the nation, we calculate the number of votes we would need in order to beat the highest turnout of the last 10 elections. We get people to commit on an individual basis to vote for this new, independent candidate.

Understanding the terribleness of the current congress, and the acute need for change, people vote. 

Three times, in six years.

That's all it takes. That's the bottom line up front.

That is 100% replacement of every single congressperson in the country. Replacing them with people who have absolutely zero interest in becoming career politicians.

This is our solution to the deficit. To money in elections. To the defense industrial complex. To the redrawing of elections districts and the rigging of elections. To the end of the electoral college. To government surveillance.

This is how we tackle these politically unviable problems.

We can do this.
