What a joy, what a treat, how inadequate are my own abilities to express my gratitude and awe. When we read you, it is to partake in such an act of
brilliant generosity, that you stoop from your towering heights of intellect, insight, and joy, choosing kindness to teach us, to allow us to wonder
in the realm of the true and real alongside you. What a matching of passion and purpose you lived your life with, and courage to pursue and reveal
truth, to help those in need, to stand up for the ignored. Your love of life and its people challenged only by your ability to understand them and
communicate, taking us by the hand across the realms of knowledge and wisdom you have acquired, to reveal the unseen behind the seen. A fearless
dedication to the truth, and toil and wondering exploration of a place of knowledge and fact, never knowing if we lessers would ever understand, but
doing so anyways. You have dented the world, you have nudged the boulder, and helped us all to help you in our smaller and greater ways to do the
same. What a joy, to swim alongside you through these pages, to understand your delight and use of language and intellect---what an absolute gem of a
human being you were! I am so grateful humans can exist as holistically incredible as you, and you inspire me and many more of us in the pursuit of
beauty, truth, insight, and to stand by our virtues even at great cost---thank you. I hope there is some manner in which we meet, beyond our
personal-impersonal meeting on the page, and I hope to be able to one day do something that would make myself worthy of sitting at a table with you,
albeit surely unworthy even then to call myself a peer, a great student I shall be. Inimitable, unique, brilliant, joyful, generous, courageous,
savoring in the delights of culture and art and society and history and language, your overflowing abundance spills off the page to those who can see
it, and I will never stop delighting in your work and mastery!
