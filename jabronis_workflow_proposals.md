Proposals
Research --- communications and sharing research, documents, links

Jira -> Slack: tracking and assigning issues and tickets, then we can use Slack as a repository for issue-based communications
For longer notes that we need to be referred back to, external communications we can use email
Dropbox folder: Sharing documents, written documents in progress for the business
Obsidian: for sharing and collaborating on the actual research (test this to see how well things get shared between us)

Notes on Jira/ Agile workflows:
 - Epics: overall, broad goals (Ex. develop a recipe for pizza)
 - Stories: the smaller but still broad tasks that make up the components of a larger goals (Ex. research types of pizzas, resarch what kinds of
     pizzas the dominant stores make, develop a dough recipe, develop a sauce recipe, etc.)
 - Tasks: the discrete, individual actions that need to be taken (Ex. list the types of pizzas that exist in a shared note, list the businesses whose
     recipes we would most like to emulate, list websites that have pizza recipes, etc.)
 - Issues: problems that arise in the process of doing tasks, stories, etc. Problems that we need to go back and address as we are working through the
     rest of these things
 - Blockers: things that are blocking another task (Ex. we can't make a pizza recipe without getting pizza cooking equipment, stuff like that)
 - In Jira, I like to have it open in an internet browser, maximum size it, and then have the Timeline -> Backlog -> Board views open in their own
     tabs in that order, so you can see the totality of the project at once
 - We also need to consider whether we will be using timelines or just free balling it

One of the goals of this workflow is to focus our efforts on one or two tasks per person at a time:
 - Go to the backlog, pick an issue you can immediately make progress on
 - Assign it to yourself (or others), move it from the backlog into the To-Do column on the board
 - When you actually start working on it and are actively working on it, move it to the In Progess column on the board. Make comments to document
     progress, let people know the status of things, discuss issues and record ideas, and to remind yourself of where you were at
 - As issues arise in the process of working on things, note the issue, link it to the task/ story/ epic (whichever is appropriate), and move that
     issue to the issues column on the board (or list blockers as they come up, linking them to the task that they are blocking)

Remote video meetings: confluence on Jira, MS Teams, Zoom, whatever

Live editing documents, collaboratively editing stuff: idk Pages, Google docs, whatever works. Md files also would be fine and are accessible from any
text editor at all, just with not notes highlighting and comments and stuff

Tracking changes to documents: git


IMMEDIATE STEPS:
 - Create a business email for:
     - The business (something like jabronispizza@gmail.com or jabronis@gmail.com or whatever looks good)
     - An account for Stewart and Sophia each
     - Use that email to build a Slack account
     - [Issue] Eventually, create a new Atlassian account and repo and move our current stuff to that account, just so that it's all shared
     - Download Obsidian, upload documents and research in a logical and organized way, ensure that we can share and edit stuff together
 - [Issue] Put these as tasks on Jira board when able, under communication organization/ infrastructure epic as stories
