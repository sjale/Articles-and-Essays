Research --- communications and sharing research, documents, links

Jira -> Slack: tracking and assigning issues and tickets, then we can use Slack as a repository for issue-based communications
For longer notes that we need to be referred back to, external communications we can use email
Dropbox folder: Sharing documents, written documents in progress for the business
Obsidian: for sharing and collaborating on the actual research (test this to see how well things get shared between us)

Notes on Jira/ Agile workflows:
 - Epics: overall, broad goals (Ex. develop a recipe for pizza)
 - Stories: the smaller but still broad tasks that make up the components of a larger goals (Ex. research types of pizzas, resarch what kinds of
     pizzas the dominant stores make, develop a dough recipe, develop a sauce recipe, etc.)
 - Tasks: the discrete, individual actions that need to be taken (Ex. list the types of pizzas that exist in a shared note, list the businesses whose
     recipes we would most like to emulate, list websites that have pizza recipes, etc.)
 - Issues: problems that arise in the process of doing tasks, stories, etc. Problems that we need to go back and address as we are working through the
     rest of these things
 - Blockers: things that are blocking another task (Ex. we can't make a pizza recipe without getting pizza cooking equipment, stuff like that)

One of the goals of this workflow is to focus our efforts on one or two tasks per person at a time:
 - Go to the backlog, pick an issue you can immediately make progress on
 - Assign it to yourself (or others), move it from the backlog into the To-Do column on the board
 - When you actually start working on it and are actively working on it, move it to the In Progess column on the board
 - As issues arise in the process of working on things, note the issue, link it to the task/ story/ epic (whichever is appropriate), and move that
     issue to the issues column on the board (or list blockers as they come up, linking them to the task that they are blocking)
