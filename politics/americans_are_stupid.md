<h2 align="center">Americans are literally just stupid</h2>  

#### And I'm sick of pretending that they aren't

It has long been recognized that having an educated, informed, and caring electorate is a key factor in the health of a democracy. If that is the
case, the stupidity of Americans is not good for the health and functioning of our nation. 

As a group, Americans are uninformed. Their perceptions of almost every political issue is contrary or askew of policies that would help address that
issue. Americans are short sighted, lack focus, and are deleteriously entitled to ignorant opinons.

Their perceptions on things like trends in crime or the performance of the economy famously has almost no bearing in reality. Poll after poll shows
that the beliefs Americans hold regarding what is occurring in the nation have almost nothing to do with what is actually occurring [a fun analysis
would be to take polling and data on a topic and see what the correlation coefficient is, to put some numbers on this].

Americans that have been activated on key issues often hold beliefs that stop changing, which is a problem because more and more issues are becoming
activated in this way to serve as wedge issues to drive elections and turnouts.

They respond poorly or wrongly to big changes. When the Patriot Act was enacted, no one cared. When Real ID was (still is) being enacted, no one
cared. When Snowden released information documenting the various ways that the government was infringing on our rights, no one cared. When states
around the nation are empowering law enforcement agencies to step closer and closer to our neck by infringing or ignoring key rights that we are
supposed to hold, there was no political backlash.

Americans do not understand how key aspects of the nation work. They do not understand the economy, how the government works or functions, the factors
of crime, what the purpose of education is and how it benefits us all. They do not understand how political campaigns work, how the media works, how
international relations work, how the military functions, or how trade works. They do not understand how technology works, how the military works, how
diplomacy works, and they do not understand the importance of participating in an elevated fashion in our politics.

This ignorance constrains our ability to meaningfully pursue policies that would help our nation. The opposition to nuclear power in the preceding
decades, the opposition to increases in the price of gasoline through gas taxes, their constant desire to have all public aid means tested, their fear
of other Americans doing well, their suspicions that anything that remotely deals with money from the government is communistic meddling in the free
market, all of these are severe constraints in "the art of the American possible"---the art of American politics.

Their lack of engagement in political campaigns at all levels of electoral races constrains who can and cannot run a viable campaign, and then when
that same lack of engagement leads to the same shitty representatives that they have always elected, who get the same shitty results time and time
again, they cry. Literally the putting a stick in your own bicycle tire meme. You did it to yourself, fam, that sucks, why did you to that to
yourself?
