<h2 align="center">The Transgender Experience</h2>

Outline:
- The most important things to know about being transgender:
    - Being transgender is not something that anyone, _at all_, wants to be. It is an almost definitionally terrible experience that causes pain and
        suffering throughout the entire process in so many different ways that it is a wonder _more_ transgender people don't just kill themselves.
    - Being transgender is not aspirational, in the sense that people are transgender because they want to _become_ something or someone else; it is
        _reactive_: it is a fleeing from a terrible feeling in the hopes of correcting or diminishing that terrible feeling.
    - Having gender dysphoria is a confusing and difficult feeling to have, it is difficult to understand in your own self, and more difficult to put
        into words in a way that meaningfully helps others understand the experience
    - Most of the political aspects of being transgender are not materially important aspects to most trans people
        - E.g. bathroom bills, transwomen playing in sports, sharing pronouns in Twitter or email or classrooms or meetings, neopronouns, "respect my
            pronouns", Dave Chappelle, drag queen story time, whatever. That's all bullshit. I wake up every day and think: what do I need to do
            today? What do I want to eat? How much water did I drink? How am I going to pay the bills? When it comes to political issues, the war in
            Ukraine, rising rental costs, and our lack of nuclear reactors in the face of an existential and fast-approaching climate catastrophe.
            Does that sound familiar? Is that what you think about every day too? (Ok, maybe not the nuclear reactors part)
        - What _is_ important to most trans people are: 
        -   being able to change our identity documents so as to not be placed into a dangerous situation every single time who we are as a person
        -   needs to be checked or verified; 
        - the ability to get the lifesavng medical treatments that we need: hormone replacement therapies, surgeries, mental health therapies; 
        - not being attacked, raped, or discriminated against; getting jobs that pay the bills so that we don't become yet another one of the
        - horrifyingly high percent of transgender people facing food insecurity and homelessness; finding a romantic partner who is both not
        - fetishizing us and also not hung up unduly about our identity, which most regard as a medical condition to be treated and resolved and never
        - thought about again
    - Trans people do not behave or function as a single group or monolith, just as others do not
        - Fun fact, there is actually a small online war between two factions of transgender people, with people who believe in the "umbrella"
            paradigm of being transgender and another group that could be described as medicalists (the name they call themselves is super stupid),
            who believe that being trans is first and foremost a medical condition, that dysphoria is the single defining feature of being
            transgender, and that if you are intentionally undertaking no medical interventions then you probably aren't actually transgender, you
            just want attention
    - Being trans is not "black face for women" or "make believe" or whatever
    - Stop judging us based on the worst fucking examples you can possibly find
    - Being trans does give us unique insights into some of the social ills of our world, but no one---_no one_---utilizes us as that resource.
    - Dating and finding love as a transgender person is just about the worst thing you can possibly have going against you as a person who just wants
        to love and be loved
        - My own experiences with Katy, and how I suspect that being transgender was part of why she left me; Christina, and how I know for a fact
            that we would have been together romantically if it wasn't for being trans
        - Being trans make sex a uniquely fraught experience, and many of us live in a fundamental sort of denial of one of the most fundamental
            aspects of being a human being
        - Then there is always the pure joy of being absolutely fetishized, and the two faced way that---men in particular---performatively behave
            regarding trans people: the outward disgust and disdain, while in private consuming immense amounts of transgender porn and engaging in
            the private hypersexual behavior towards transgender women
    - Transwomen are not the only trans people for fucks sake.
    - I do not consider being non-binary to be the same as being transgender and neo-pronouns are stupid and probably not even real. Please shut the
        fuck up about them, forever.
    - Puberty blockers are a life saving treatment that seem to resolve many of society's greatest hang-ups about trans people, but because it has
        been literally weaponized as an issue to drive right-wing political engagement [insert links to Chris Ruffo's horseshit antics], we leave a
        wonderful medical and policy tool on the table for essentially no good reason, in the cruelly-ironic notion of protecting the children. Whose
        children? Which children? _Your children_, that are _cisgendered_. Their protection will literally be bought through the deaths and decades of
        now children and the adults that they will become, unhappy in their bodies forever because of the fact that you stupid fuck voters can't be
        assed to read a goddamn couple of news articles
    - We _know that you will never understand us and what we have experienced_---that is _ok_; we _ask_ that you, in the words of Dave Chappelle's
        Daphne, try to "understand that we are having a human moment" instead of avoiding or being overly fascinated by us or being repulsed by us or
        demonizing us for your shitty political wars
    - My own belief: there is just no fucking way that you guys care this much about us that we are a central political issue. The left doesn't care
        or understand us, they just performatively signal their support for us; the right cannot possibly hate us or think about us this often,
        outside of a few mentally deranged freaks, they just like to fuck with our lives to throw some red meat to people who would have voted for
        them anyways because then they don't have to do anything meaningful to better the lives of their constituents: "We protected the children from
        the big bad transes, now look the other way as we continue to destroy the world and make your life even more of a shithole than it was before
        we took office, thank you very much."
    - We know that we cannot change our sex, thank you very much for the constant reminders. We also know that we will probably never be 100% happy
        with our bodies or our transitions, and that we will probably never fully "be" one gender or the other.
    - There _is_ a meaningful overlap in the gender-experiences of those who have transitioned, enough so that it warrants membership in the group:
        transmen will look and behave enough like men that it is sensible and correct to call them men; transwomen will often look and behave enough
        like women that it is sensible and correct to call them women (and have all the weird and negative experiences concomitant with being a woman
        in this hellscape of a society that we have created).
    - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD stop throwing around those shitty studies and talking about rapid on gender whatever the fuck. They are so annoying
    - Being transgender really does have nothing to do with sex or being a pervert or having kinks. I am a great example, where I barely even want to
        have sex and when I do it is just about the most boring vanilla shit you can imagine. My biggest kink is the very normal blindfold
    - Stop trying to pit trans people and detransitioners against each other. They are probably the only two groups that could begin to understand
        what the other one is going through, and both can help the other. Both groups have almost no true friends in the world, and my heart
        especially goes out to those who detransition, for any reason. It's a horrible thing to happen to a person and they deserve empathy, respect,
        and the support of those who can understand. What an evil thing to try to do, to pit two groups against each other.
