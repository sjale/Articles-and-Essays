Outline:
* The way that IQ is conceptualized and operationalized is just not good or sound, even for the beginning of a conceptual framework, which is also
    exactly what it is
* The so-called predictiveness of it is just asinine, and is likely the misconstruation of reading results around backwards, believing that
    achievement and education and success comes from IQ, when it's the other way around and the interaction goes both ways
* Insofar as it is studied, one of the implicit but unstated goals is not to only understand populations, an actually useful and clinical thing, but
    to understand greatness and genius, these things which all humans are naturally fascinated by. Of course, IQ can never measure such things, for it
    could never measure the inspiration, toil, perception, creativity, in-it-ness, flow, experiences, understanding, insights, and effort that it
    takes to be and produce greatness; how could any measure capture those key ingredients of endeavor and success? --- what a truly impossible thing.
    But it CAN and DOES lead to non-clinicians believing that IQ determines self worth; that IQ _is_ intelligence, in one of the most widespread
    conflations of all time, and it _does_ lead to people self-selecting from the game of life in a way that is probably the most magnificent and
    damaging self-own in human history. Whatever IQ measures, it sure as hell has little to do with happiness, goodness, decency, hard work, or worth,
    and it sure as hell has very little to do with actual accomplishment and striving; but it sure as hell undermines all of those things and leads to
    the two negative fascinations that are so damaging and toxic --- good people feeling bad, disqualifying themselves, avoiding dreams, setting their
    goals and sights lower --- and the opposite, of those who really shouldn't have such a high self worth having a high self worth --- just check out
    these jackasses at Mensa, sitting around, smelling their own farts --- and for many of those who _should_ have a high self of self worth but need
    to match it with effort and inspiration and passion and understanding, to substitute all of those things simply for the possession of high IQ,
    thereby hurting the world's progress in yet another fuckin way because of this stupid goddamn test
* People should never know their own IQ, and they shouldn't measure their sense of self worth by it, and the IQ --- from a clinical and scientific
    perspective --- will one day be reworked and updated and changed (I hope, at least). One day we will look back at this and say "wow, that was
    really stupid policy, how could so many smart people have been so obviously in error?" And we will have no one to blame but ourselves.
* IQ forming the basis for differential education and resource tracks is, understandably, problematic
* IQ changes over time, and I believe research will one day show that the human intelligence is far more flexible and responsive to certain kinds of
    experiences and types of thought and functions of mind than we currently believe is possible
* IQ is and continues to be a major vector of racism and false-distinctions between groups, and the belief of superiority-inferiority, when again, it
    really just isn't useful or helpful in any way for these purposes --- not that racists will stop finding ways to be racist without IQ-related
    data, but holy fuck let's not give them even more ammunition, and especially not ammunition that is so clearly intended only for niche scientific
    research in such a poorly conceptualized and infant state of research. It smacks of "we created a measure and a field and got some interesting
    results, let's use and abuse this result and spread it all over the world and governments and society and the minds of our children because we
    want to feel good and special with these completely limited and flawed scientific results! Look at me, I scienced good!" 
* IQ measurements also lead to a pervasive sense of bioessentialist DNA-predestination; people see that the r value of IQ with x y z outcomes is such
    and such value and that the heritability (so stupid... like, seriously?) is relatively high in comparison to other measured traits of human
    beings, and thus we again confuse the results for the causes and limit and harm human potential and the progress of the world. Who cares if your
    IQ is high or not high? Can do _do_ stuff? Are you a _good person_? Are you creative and do you possess keen faculties of insight and the wisdom
    to fashion these insights into productive work and great virtue? IQ won't help you, at all, with any of that, and _those things_ are the things
    that people need and should be. Who gives a fuck about IQ?
* How about we just measure the outcomes of specific types of faculties, specific types of performances and functions, give various interventions,
    measure the results of those interventions, and find ways that we can help people grow and evolve and learn and improve? Maybe that, super fuckin
    obvious method that would be actually-scientific instead of just some harebrained observed correlation, would actually get us closer to the goals
    of understanding human achievement and intelligence and also help improve the world and its people along the way? Do you think Shakespeare knew
    his IQ, or that if it was measured it would matter at all? What about all the people with the same exact or higher IQs who could never hope to
    begin to achieve one single percent of what he accomplished? Would his IQ help his prolific output of some of the most beautiful and penetrating
    and artistically courageous works to have ever been produced? Could it help replicate a mind as noble and kind and generous and passionate as his?
    How could it? And how many would-have-been-greats have just dropped out of the game because their IQ wasn't "high enough?" 
* One of the aspects of knowing one's own IQ, is that it is one of those things that is never enough. It's like height, or winning a local basketball
    league. There will basically always be someone with a higher IQ than yours, and instead of viewing yourself as higher in intelligence (which is
    already, again, a flawed understanding of the measure) than the percentile of people beneath you, you will always focus on what you don't have and
    the fact that there will always be people better than you, and then enters the "why try" "I'm not good enough" "those other people must just be
    better" type of accomplishment-terminating mental and emotional processes _industrially produced and disseminated through the world_ by _only this
    measure and the incredible damages it must surely have caused the world_.
