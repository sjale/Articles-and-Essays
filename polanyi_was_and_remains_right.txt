Explaining what is happening today through a Polanyian lens

Explain: What Polanyi posited as the explanation for the rise of fascism. This also relates to Reaganism, Wallerstein’s theories on the source of financial crashes, and Anderson’s idea of nation-states as imagined 
communities

Polanyi was a Hungarian anthropologist, historian, and political thinker who wrote a book called "The Great
Transformation" seeking to explain why and how nations turned towards fascism
during the early decades of the 20th century. He argues that our current
economics system, that of orthodox free-market economics, is:
    1) Contrary to the primary modes of economic organization that have
    historically existed in human societies
    2) That it was artificially created and foisted upon society
    3) That when this sphere of human activity, which is in actuality the sum
    of methods that a society uses to organize and distribute limited resources
    across a population, becomes disembedded from the rest of society, or when
    it is allowed to subsume--to "take over" or place within itself the rest of
    society, human beings will rebel strongly against this development. 
    4) What that rebellion entails is the establishment of a political system
    which subsumes everything beneath _it_: everything becomes the political,
    rather than everything being the economic. This is the Polanyian definition
    of fascism: a political system under which the economic, social, religious,
    legal, and cultural aspects of human life and society are subject to the control
    and demands of the political sphere, and as such under which all things
    become political.
    5) Polanyi argues that the reason that some Western liberal nations did not
    fall into this trap was because of their more-responsive liberal
    institutions and political systems, which enabled them to re-embed the
    economic sphere under that of the social and political and so on spheres.
    This ameliorates the conditions which breed fascism, that inhuman crushing
    of human life under the economic mode of life, and thereby enables the
    survival of liberal democracy.

Show: how that is occurring today
    1) List the nations that became fascist and authoritarian; and which ones
    didn't; why those nations that did not did not, and why those nations that
    did did so.
    2) In the examples of the US and Russia, the US existed under a system in
    which the economic mode was broadly embedded in society due to FDR
    economics; in Russia, this was (obviously) accomplished through
    Stalinist-communism. Ronald Reagan's policies of privatization and the
    freeing of the economic sphere of the US led to the re-disembedding of the
    economic from the remaining aspects of society, with all of the deleterious
    effects on human life and health that are historically concomitant with
    such changes, and the collapse of the soviet union with its widespread
    material suffering and their own steps towards economic liberalization led
    to the same anti-human modes of life.

    In the US, the culmination of these policies has been the rise of
    right-wing reactionary parties: the 1990's republicans, the late 2000's Tea
    Party movement, and finally in the proto-fascist MAGA movement; all at the
    same time as the democratic side of politics has been waylaid and gainsayed
    by orthodox economic policies, which in this frame only serve to exacerbate
    the issues causing the right-wing movements towards authoritarianism.
    Russia obviously went with the revanchist and irredentist former KGB agent
    Putin and became a hollowed out authoritarian oligarchist-cartel system in
    which the rights of the Russian people have been slowly eroded, obviously
    culminating in the classical, historically-expected actions of invading
    their neighbors to take their shit.

    The disembedding of the economic creates a polarized push towards extreme
    political solutions, helped along by changes in media environments, bad
    faith social and political entrepreneurship, business extractiveness and
    income and wealth disparities, and an intentional crippling of the
    political institutions whose function it is to address these concers; these
    in turn lead to greater anger, greater resentments, greater apathy, greater
    cynicisms, and so on, in the remaining spheres of society and in the hearts
    and minds of voters. A vicious cycle.

    In other parts of the world, probably in part due to the same sort of
    economic global liberalization, advanced economies flirt or succumb to
    these same far right parties. In nations as widely separate Germany, Poland, the UK, France, Italy,
    Japan, Korea, Israel, Brazil, Honduras, El Salvador, Spain, India, etc. there have
    been simultaneous turns towards these same kinds of right-wing reactionary
    resentment politics culminating in authoritarian political parties. 

    The nations that have not made this shift include Australia, New Zealand, the
    nordic countries, etc.: in short, _countries in which the economic mode has
    remained embedded under the other spheres, subject to the demands of
    government, politics, society, culture, etc.

    **No other theory explains this type of massive shift better than
    Polanyianism.**

    

Relate it to: the schizophrenic shifting between authoritarianism and liberalism on the world stage today
* The rise of cynicism and the ironsphere and a “burn it all down” mentality
* The vacuousness of our culture and art and the exploitation of our most deeply held virtues for business gains
* Notions of orthodox economics that seem to fly deeply in the face of deep set human behaviors, such as the exportation of jobs to other nations 
* When our society and institutions become unresponsive to the demands of voters and the widely held perception is one of being exploited into the ground instead of flourishing, it not only undermines our own institutions’ abilities to function, but it lends credence to the functioning of other systems. It becomes easier for people to give a look to things totally contrary to what would benefit them and allows adversarial systems to be hyped in ways that they don’t deserve and don’t bear out under scrutiny. It’s an own goal of massive proportions

What this means: Polanyi’s assertions that the solution is responsive liberal institutions and a re-embedding of the economic into the social sphere, as opposed to without it or a world in which the economic sphere has subsumed all others
* Establish: that our economic system has become extractive rather than generative, that people feel the anguish Polanyi described and that they are expressing it through that today, and American democracy is at a low point in terms of responsiveness to the demands of voters and trust in our institutions
