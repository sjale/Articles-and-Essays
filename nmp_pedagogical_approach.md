some of the major pedagogical approaches taken, inadvertantly and on purpose, in this approach to teaching mathematics:
- A focus on gradual notational fluency through the earlier and progressive introduction of notation, and thoroughly dealing with that notation as it
    appears
- A focus on the conceptual: taking things out of the implementation and complexity level to focus on the high level interactions of the various
    concepts that are under study and under instruction; human beings seem to be far more capable of conceptual interaction and manipulation than
    otherwise; focusing on the _what_ we are doing as well as the _how_ we are doing it
- a top down approach that helps to systematize exposure to mathematics
- a more rational exposure to topics
- being clear and explicit about what level of abstraction we are working with, and practically and explicitly stating when we move up and down in
    that complexity hierarchy
- an introduction to many areas and topics of mathematics early on, so that when they come up later there will already have been a "touching upon"
    level of familiarity and fluency that already exists
- a road map perspective of the entirety of mathematics, and a focus on what mathematics actually _is_ and the processes for how it is done
- Lots of repetition, lots of review, and lots of applying things that we have already learned in more contexts and to different mathematical objects
- A focus on why something is true and how it is true, and how we go about verifying that truthhood---an introduction to proof, evidence, and rigor
    essentially
